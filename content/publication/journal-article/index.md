abstract: Learning a disentangled representation is a significant challenge in the field of the interpretability of generative adversarial networks (GANs). To this end, this paper proposes a generic method to automatically learn interpretable filters inside GANs, where filters in an intermediate layer of the generator encode the disentangled and localized visual concepts. Each filter in the layer is expected to consistently generate image regions corresponding to the same visual concept when generating different images. Different filters in the layer are expected to generate image regions corresponding to different visual concepts. Such clarified and symbolic knowledge representations provide people with a clear understanding of the generation process inside the GAN. Our interpretable GANs also enable people to modify a specific visual concept on generated images by manipulating feature maps of the corresponding filters in the layer. Besides, our method does not require any annotations of visual concepts in the train data. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various datasets and models with different structures, demonstrating that our method successfully boosts the feature interpretability inside GANs and provides people with access to perform flexible manipulations on generated images.
